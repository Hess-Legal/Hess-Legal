- 👋 Hi, I’m Eric Hess, @Hess-Legal
- 👀 I’m interested in the law, regulation, security and business of digital assets and DeFi
- 🌱 Hess Legal is my law firm and my practice is primarily focused on digital assets, traditional capital markets and exempt securities offerings, but I am a nerd when it comes to encryption of data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DeFi, marketplace guidance and regulation and cool ideas for deep dives on my Encrypted Economy podcast
- 📫 How to reach me eric@hesslegalcounsel.com or @hess_legal on Twitter
